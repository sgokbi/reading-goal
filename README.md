## [Reading Goal](https://reading-goal.netlify.app/) (https://reading-goal.netlify.app/)

### Introduction

In this project users can add their completed reading books by clicking the button "Mark as read". When the user marks the book as a completed reading book, the clicked book name will be listed in the cart containing all the completed reading book lists. Besides the book name, the reading time on each book will be shown in the cart, and counting on each time as a total time when more books will be added to the cart as a completed reading book. And also in the project local storage is used to keep the user's data for a while and retrieve it and show it in the UI when the user comes back.

### Purpose

This project idea is developed to keep listed and track all the completed reading books in an easy way by only clicking a button as done reading.
